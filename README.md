## PWSched Backend

This is the backend RESTful API for the PWSched shift scheduling app.  Front end can be found [here](https://github.com/davevanfleet/pwsched-frontend) (also still in development).  

This app is built to provide an easy means of scheduling public witnessing activities. Volunteers create an account and are associated with only their congregation. The app is designed to make it easy for volunteers to request shifts.
1. Service Overseers or other admins create a shift
2. Volunteers request the shifts they would like
3. Admin assigns shifts as appropriate and volunteers are notified via email.

This app is currently in development, and is being refactored from a full-stack Ruby on Rails app (found at https://github.com/dvfleet413/PWSched) during the COVID-19 pandemic, while ther's no need for it in production!  The refactored app will be written with a much cleaner, more scalable, more performant codebase.
